Meat stands as a vital protein source, pivotal for numerous diets worldwide, emphasizing freshness, tenderness, and freedom from contamination, crucial for consumer well-being and contentment. Over the past two 
decades, a notable uptick in global meat consumption has emerged, propelled by escalating demands for livestock and poultry products, alongside a surge in meat imports. However, conventional methods for assessing 
meat freshness often rely on subjective evaluations or demand costly equipment, presenting notable limitations. To address these challenges, our innovative web-based system has been crafted, transcending these 
constraints. It harnesses the power of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs), meticulously trained on an extensive dataset of labeled meat images. Users seamlessly upload pictures, initiating the process where You 
Only Look Once (YOLOv5), an advanced object detection tool, swiftly pinpoints the meat within the image. Subsequently, the CNN meticulously analyzes this specific area, discerning subtle visual indicative of 
freshness. This cutting-edge web-based approach delivers unparalleled accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and scalability in comparison to prevailing methods. By seamlessly merging deep learning with object 
detection, our system empowers consumers, suppliers, regulators, and anyone with an internet connection to make well-informed decisions regarding meat quality. With an impressive accuracy rate of 94%, this 
technological advancement ensures heightened confidence and reliability in meat quality assessment, thus fostering a safer and more satisfying consumer experience.
